<h1>Sample Output :</h1>

Total number of input : 10 <br />
Enter 10 elements : 8 4 7 -2 7 4 -1 0 6 2 <br />
User Inputs are [8, 4, 7, -2, 7, 4, -1, 0, 6, 2] <br />
Do you want to reverse ? Y/N : y <br />
Reverse linkedlist is [2, 6, 0, -1, 4, 7, -2, 7, 4, 8] <br />
Do you want to reverse ? Y/N : n <br />
Do you want to insert ? Y/N : y <br />
Enter index to insert : 0 <br />
Enter elements to insert : 0 <br />
Do you want to insert ? Y/N : y <br />
Enter index to insert : 1 <br />
Enter elements to insert : 1 <br />
Do you want to insert ? Y/N : n <br />
Do you want to Print LinkedList ? Y/N : y <br />
linked list : [0, 1, 2, 6, 0, -1, 4, 7, -2, 7, 4, 8] <br />
Do you want to sort ? Y/N : y <br />
Sorted linked list is [-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8] <br />
Do you want to remove at any index ? Y/N : y <br />
Enter index to remove : 11 <br />
New linked list is [-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7] <br />
Do you want to remove at any index ? Y/N : n <br />
Do you want to remove first occurance of an element ? Y/N : y <br />
Enter element to remove : 4 <br />
New linked list is [-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 7] <br />
Do you want to remove first occurance of an element ? Y/N : n <br />
Do you want to an remove all occurance of an element? Y/N : y <br />
Enter element to remove: 0 <br />
After removing [-2, -1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 7] <br />
Do you want to an remove all occurance of an element? Y/N : n <br />
Do you want to Print LinkedList ? Y/N : y <br />
linked list : [-2, -1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 7] <br />
Do you arrange elements in decreasingEvenPosition and increasingOddPosition? Y/N : y <br />
Odd inc, Even dec position[-2, 7, 1, 6, 4, 2, 7, -1] <br />
